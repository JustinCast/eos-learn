## What is a consensus algorithm ? ##

A consensus algorithm is a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems.

Blockchain technology relies on consensus algorithms to reach agreement among nodes. A blockchain can be thought of as a decentralized database that is managed by distributed computers on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Each peer maintains a copy of the ledger to prevent a single point of failure (SPOF). Updates and validations are reflected in all copies simultaneously.

Other common consensus algorithms include the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT), the proof-of-stake algorithm (PoS) and the delegated proof-of-stake algorithm (DPoS).

## DPOS ##

EOS.IO software utilizes the only known decentralized consensus algorithm proven capable of meeting the performance requirements of applications on the blockchain, [Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)](https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper). Under this algorithm, those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system. Anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks, provided they can persuade token holders to vote for them.
